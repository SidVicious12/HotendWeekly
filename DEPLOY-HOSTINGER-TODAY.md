---

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Access Hostinger**
1. Log in to Hostinger control panel
2. Go to **File Manager**
3. Navigate to **`public_html`**

### **Step 2: Clear Old Files**
**IMPORTANT**: Delete everything in `public_html`:
- Select all files and folders
- Delete them

### **Step 3: Upload New Files**
1. In File Manager, make sure you're in `public_html`
2. Click **Upload**
3. Navigate to: `/Users/SidVicious/HotendWeekly/out/`
4. **Upload ALL files and folders:**
   - `_next` folder
   - `backgrounds` folder
   - `branding` folder
   - `404` folder
   - `auth` folder ⭐ NEW
   - `index.html`
   - `404.html`
   - `favicon.svg`
   - All other files

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: What Will Work & What Won't**

### ✅ **Will Work:**
- Landing page loads
- Beautiful UI
- Login/Signup pages display
- Upload interface shows
- Download button works

### ❌ **Won't Work on Hostinger:**
- ❌ **Authentication** (no Node.js server)
- ❌ **Protected routes** (anyone can access)
- ❌ **User sessions**
- ❌ **API key is exposed in JavaScript**

---

## 🔒 **Security Status on Hostinger:**

**⚠️ RISK:** Your Remove.bg API key is embedded in the JavaScript and can be viewed by anyone.

**What This Means:**
- Anyone can open browser dev tools
- See your API key
- Use your 50 free API calls
- Potentially rack up charges

**Recommendation:**
- Deploy to Hostinger TODAY for demo/testing
- Move to Vercel TOMORROW for production
- This keeps your API secure with real authentication

---

## 🎯 **Tomorrow's Plan: Move to Vercel**

**Why Vercel:**
- ✅ Real authentication works
- ✅ Protected API key
- ✅ User sessions
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ Can use hotendweekly.com domain
- ✅ Takes 5 minutes to set up

**For Tomorrow:**
1. Create Vercel account (free)
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy (automatic)
5. Point hotendweekly.com to Vercel
