## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture:
```
User Upload ‚Üí Next.js API Route ‚Üí Remove.bg API ‚Üí Canvas Compositing ‚Üí Download
```

### Files Created:
- `src/app/api/remove-bg/route.ts` - API route for background removal
- `.env.local` - Environment variables (NOT committed to git)
- `public/backgrounds/backgrounds.json` - Background definitions

### Security:
- API key stored in `.env.local` (git-ignored)
- Server-side API calls (API key never exposed to client)
- Next.js API routes handle authentication

## üöß Current Limitations

1. **Watermark**: All downloads include "HotendWeekly" watermark
   - Future: Remove watermark for paid users
2. **One image at a time**: No batch processing yet
3. **No image history**: Can't save/revisit processed images
4. **Basic backgrounds**: Limited to 6 preset backgrounds

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Future Features)

1. **User Authentication** - Save your processed images
2. **Custom Backgrounds** - Upload your own backgrounds
3. **Batch Processing** - Process multiple images at once
4. **Remove Watermark** - Paid tier removes watermark
5. **More Backgrounds** - Lifestyle scenes, product stages, etc.
6. **Video Support** - Turntable animations for 3D prints

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"Failed to process image" error:**
- Check that your API key is correct in `.env.local`
- Verify you have API calls remaining (check Remove.bg dashboard)
- Restart dev server after adding API key

**Image not showing background:**
- Make sure image uploaded successfully
- Check browser console for errors
- Try a different background option

**Watermark not showing:**
- This is expected behavior - watermark applies during canvas composition
- Download the image to see watermark

## üìù Deployment Notes

**For Hostinger:**
1. Build the project: `npm run export`
2. Add your API key to Hostinger's environment variables
3. Upload `out/` folder contents to `public_html`

**Environment Variables on Hostinger:**
- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_REMOVEBG_API_KEY` in control panel
- Or create `.env.local` on the server (less secure)
